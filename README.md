DuoTone themes use only 2 hues (8 shades in total). It __tones down__ less
important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the
__important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you
find the stuff you're looking for.

## Language support

DuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:

> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java,
> JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML,
> YAML...

See the list of [all languages](/styles/languages).

## Variations

Here a list of all [DuoTone
themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone). Or at
least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:
